## Amazon Data

Estimate and predict the rating according to the comments of each item in distributed fashion. <br>
All scripts are under Amazon Project where is the report as well (Predicting Ratings of Amazon Products Using Review Texts.pdf).<br>
It is basically a benchmark between some classification and regression algorithms.<br>
The benchmark was tested in a cluster of 20 old-machines of [LIACS](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/).
There is also a file Dask_Demo.ipynb which is a mini tutorial about [DASK](https://dask.org/), an open source python library for Distributed Data Analysis.
